# Workout app 

The workout app is mainly for anyone that workouts at the gym or at home. this workout app will give you a specific workout to help you stay healthy and get in the best shape possible. Right now my app has two features, The first one is basically a list of workouts that you might have planned for that day. And the second is where you can add to that current list of workouts you have for yourself that day. Once you click on the second link you are able to write down the workout you might want to add and also the reps and rest time and then click the log workout button which will take that information and add it to your list you currently have. I also hope to add a link that will have work plans and diet plans for that person to choose from and help them get to their goal.
